The Vikings were people who lived in Northern Europe a long time ago, and they loved to explore and trade with other lands. They also loved to tell stories and poems about their gods and goddesses, who had amazing powers and personalities. The Vikings did not have a book or a scripture to write down their stories, but they passed them on from one generation to the next by speaking and singing."

        "title": "Aeschylus",
        "content": "Often described as the father of tragedy by both Ancient Greek authors and modern scholars, Aeschylus is the earliest playwright whose works have survived to this day and age. Born into a well-to-do family at Eleusis in 525/4 BC, he debuted on the stage in the twenty-sixth year of his life, but achieved his first victory only fifteen years later, in 484. However, after this triumph, he was probably victorious almost every time he competed at the City Dionysia until his death, eventually amassing no less than 13 wins, a feat surpassed only by his younger contemporary Sophocles (24). Only seven out of the 70 to 90 plays he is supposed to have written during his life have survived: Persians, Seven Against Thebes, Suppliants, Agamemnon, Libation Bearers, Eumenides, and Prometheus Bound. Agamemnon, Libation Bearers and Eumenides constitute a single story and are part of a trilogy called the Oresteia, which is the only ancient example of this form to have reached us. Oresteia might have been Aeschylus last play because soon after producing it he left (for the second time) to Sicily, where he died in 456/5 BC. Interestingly enough, the inscription on Aeschylus‚Äô gravestone commemorates only his military achievements and makes no mention of his status as the foremost playwright of his day and age."

        "title": "Aristophanes",
        "content": "Routinely described as ‚Äúthe father of comedy‚Äù and ‚Äúthe greatest ancient comic writer,‚Äù Aristophanes was born in the early 440s, most probably in 447/6. He debuted barely out of his teenage years with The Banqueters in 427 BC (now lost), and won the first prize at both the Dionysia and the Lenaea with his following two plays: The Babylonians and The Acharnians. Unfortunately, his attack on some of the Athenian customs caught the eye of the most powerful politician of the day, Cleon, who denounced him before the Athenian council. Instead of backing down, Aristophanes went on attacking Cleon incessantly ‚Äì even after the politician died in 422 BC. He practically dominated the 420s with no less than seven prizes, but he seems to have enjoyed fewer successes afterward: we don‚Äôt hear of an Aristophanic victory before 405 BC when he produced The Frogs. The play was reperformed by civic decree the very next year, but this might have been a political maneuver by the Thirty Oligarchs, a pro-Spartan coalition that came to power in Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War. A conservative, Aristophanes may have even sided with them, but even if that was the case, he reclaimed his reputation afterward and won first prizes with some of his last plays: the surviving Wealth and the lost Cocalus. All in all, he seems to have written about 40 comedies, of which 11 survive to this day. They are all examples of a style called Old Comedy, but it can be argued that Wealth is already a Middle Comedy play, and, based on what we know, Cocalus may have anticipated almost all of the elements typical for New Comedy. Innovative until the very end, Aristophanes is practically the only Ancient comic author that can be studied more closely today. Even though already in Antiquity, Aristophanes‚Äô fame was eclipsed by that of the New Comedy author Menander, all but one of Menander‚Äôs plays were somehow lost during the Middle Ages. In spite of their topicality and choral style, one-fourth of Aristophanes‚Äô comedies survived ‚Äì and most of them are regularly performed and adapted throughout the world today."

        "title": "Euripides",
        "content": "Born (most probably) in 480 BC, the year of the Battle of Salamis, in the eastern suburbs of Athens, Euripides was the last and most rebellious of the three great Ancient Greek tragedians. He debuted in the year of Aeschylus‚Äô death (455) and won his first victory 14 years later with an unknown tragedy. He won the first prize three more times during his life, and once posthumously ‚Äì with a tetralogy produced either by his son or nephew named Euripides that included Iphigenia in Aulis, Alcmaeon and Bacchae. Most probably, all of these plays were written at the court of King Archelaus of Macedon, where Euripides was either exiled or chose to retire soon after producing Orestes in 408. Even though most ancient sources ascribe 92 plays to Euripides‚Äô name, 4 of them seem to have been dubious even to ancient scholars. Out of the remaining 88, 14 were probably lost even when the Alexandrian librarians decided to catalogue them in the third century BC, and only 19 have survived complete to this day. One of these (Rhesus) is spurious, one (Iphigenia in Aulis) was certainly left unfinished by Euripides, and a third one (Cyclops) is the only complete satyr-play to reach us in entirety. Even though Euripides wasn‚Äôt very successful during his lifetime‚Äîhe won 8 victories less than Aeschylus and 13 less than Sophocles‚Äîthe very things that might have made him unpopular in fifth-century Athens (his skepticism and unconventionality, as well as his conceivably radical views on war, religion and patriarchy) resonate loudly with audiences today, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is considered the most modern and most individualistic of all three great tragedians."

        "title": "Sophocles",
        "content": "Though Aeschylus was considered ‚Äúthe father of tragedy‚Äù by almost everybody in the ancient world, Sophocles was generally more loved, and his plays were often considered a better specimen of the genre. Born into a wealthy family at Colonus just a few years before the battle of Marathon (most probably 496 BC), Sophocles debuted at the City Dionysia in 468 BC and, according to Plutarch, immediately turned the attention to himself, triumphing over Aeschylus, for years the sovereign ruler of the Ancient Greek stage. After the death of his predecessor (456/5 BC), Sophocles became the preeminent playwright in Athens, a title he held onto for the next half a century, practically until his very death at the age of 90 in the winter of 406/5 BC. During this period, Sophocles is said to have authored over 120 plays, only seven of which survive to this day in their entirety: Antigone, Ajax, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. Ancient sources claim that Sophocles competed 30 times at the tragic festivals and that 24 times he won the first prize; he was placed second the other six. Even while still alive, Sophocles came to be regarded as one of the wisest men in all of Greece, and soon after his death authors such as Aristophanes and Phrynichus paid warm tributes to him, paving the way for the subsequent canonization of both his name and his oeuvre."
