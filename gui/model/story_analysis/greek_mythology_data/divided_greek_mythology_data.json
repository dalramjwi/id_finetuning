A conservative, Aristophanes may have even sided with them, but even if that was the case, he reclaimed his reputation afterward and won first prizes with some of his last plays: the surviving Wealth and the lost Cocalus.

Even though already in Antiquity, Aristophanes‚Äô fame was eclipsed by that of the New Comedy author Menander, all but one of Menander‚Äôs plays were somehow lost during the Middle Ages. In spite of their topicality and choral style, one-fourth of Aristophanes‚Äô comedies survived ‚Äì and most of them are regularly performed and adapted throughout the world today."

He debuted in the year of Aeschylus‚Äô death (455) and won his first victory 14 years later with an unknown tragedy. He won the first prize three more times during his life, and once posthumously ‚Äì with a tetralogy produced either by his son or nephew named Euripides that included Iphigenia in Aulis, Alcmaeon and Bacchae.

Out of the remaining 88, 14 were probably lost even when the Alexandrian librarians decided to catalogue them in the third century BC, and only 19 have survived complete to this day.

        "introduction": "Often described as the father of tragedy by both Ancient Greek authors and modern scholars, Aeschylus is the earliest playwright whose works have survived to this day and age. Born into a well-to-do family at Eleusis in 525/4 BC, he debuted on the stage in the twenty-sixth year of his life, but achieved his first victory only fifteen years later, in 484. However, after this triumph, he was probably victorious almost every time he co",

Interestingly enough, the inscription on Aeschylus‚Äô gravestone commemorates only his military achievements and makes no mention of his status as the foremost playwright of his day and age."

        "introduction": "Routinely described as ‚Äúthe father of comedy‚Äù and ‚Äúthe greatest ancient comic writer,‚Äù Aristophanes was born in the early 440s, most probably in 447/6. He debuted barely out of his teenage years with The Banqueters in 427 BC (now lost), and won the first prize at both the Dionysia and the Lenaea with his following two plays: The Babylonians and The Acharnians. Unfortunately, his attack on some of the Athenian customs caught the eye of the most powerful politician of the day, Cleon, who denounced him before the Athenian council. Instead of backing down, Aristophanes went on attacking Cleon incessantly ‚Äì even after the politician died in 422 BC. He practically dominated the 420s with no less tha",

The play was reperformed by civic decree the very next year, but this might have been a political maneuver by the Thirty Oligarchs, a pro-Spartan coalition that came to power in Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War. A conservative, Aristophanes may have even sided with them, but even if that was the case, he reclaimed his reputation afterward and won first prizes with some of his last plays: the surviving Wealth and the lost Cocalus. All in all, he seems to have written about 40 comedies, of which 11 survive to this day. They are al",
        "conclusion": "l examples of a style called Old Comedy, but it can be argued that Wealth is already a Middle Comedy play, and, based on what we know, Cocalus may have anticipated almost all of the elements typical for New Comedy. Innovative until the very end, Aristophanes is practically the only Ancient comic author that can be studied more closely today. Even though already in Antiquity, Aristophanes‚Äô fame was eclipsed by that of the New Comedy author Menander, all but one of Menander‚Äôs plays were somehow lost during the Middle Ages. In spite of their topicality and choral style, one-fourth of Aristophanes‚Äô comedies survived ‚Äì and most of them are regularly performed and adapted throughout the world today."

He debuted in the year of Aeschylus‚Äô death (455) and won his first victory 14 years later with an unknown tragedy. He won the first prize three more times during his life, and once posthumously ‚Äì with a tetralogy produced either by his son or nephew named Euripides that included Iphigenia in Aulis, Alcmaeon and Bacchae.

Out of the remaining 88, 14 were probably lost even when the Alexandrian librarians decided to catalogue them in the third century BC, and only 19 have survived complete to this day. One of these (Rhesus) is spurious, one (Iphigenia in Aulis) was certainly left unfinished by Euripides, and a thir",

Even though Euripides wasn‚Äôt very successful during his lifetime‚Äîhe won 8 victories less than Aeschylus and 13 less than Sophocles‚Äîthe very things that might have made him unpopular in fifth-century Athens (his skepticism and unconventionality, as well as his conceivably radical views on war, religion and patriarchy) resonate loudly with audiences today, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is considered the most modern and most individualistic of all three great tragedians."

During this period, Sophocles is said to have authored over 120 plays, only seven of which survive to this day in their entirety: Antigone, Ajax, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra,",

Ancient sources claim that Sophocles competed 30 times at the tragic festivals and that 24 times he won the first prize; he was placed second the other six.
